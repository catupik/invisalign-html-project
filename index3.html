        <h2 class="heading">Invisalign Aligners vs. Braces</h2>
        <p class="descr2">Invisalign aligners and braces use different methods to straighten teeth, but they are both reliable, effective tools used by orthodontists to produce healthy bites and beautiful smiles. Many patients prefer Invisalign for the discreet appearance of the aligners, as well as the added comfort and convenience. Braces, however, tend to be cheaper than Invisalign, and for qualifying younger patients may be fully covered by Invisalign.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">How Does Invisalign Treatment Work?</h2>
            <p class="descr2"> The Invisalign system is a revolutionary technology that straightens your teeth without the appearance of metal brackets and wires. Instead, Invisalign aligners are made of transparent, flexible plastic, designed for your unique case, to carefully and precisely move your teeth into their correct positions. When worn, they are nearly invisible.

                Using patented SmartTrack™ material, the aligners are comfortable and biocompatible, fitting snugly over your teeth. Most treatments use a top and bottom aligner, each designed by your orthodontist to safely shift your teeth. You’ll receive a new set every <span>1-2 </span> weeks, and then will swap out for a new set. Each one shifts your teeth closer to their correct positions.
                
                Depending on your case, your doctor may also use SmartForce attachments, which are tooth-colored holds that affix to certain teeth to give the aligners added grip. You may also use rubber bands, which connect the top and bottom teeth to further assist the precision movement of your teeth into their correct positions.
                
                When your treatment is complete, you’ll be provided with retainers, which will help protect the results of your Invisalign clear aligner treatment. You’ll wear retainers every night for the first few months, and then a few nights a week after that.</p>

        <p class="descr2">Whether you will need to wear rubber bands depends on the Invisalign treatment plan devised by your orthodontist. If rubber bands are a part of your treatment, it’s important to wear them as instructed to achieve the best results with your Invisalign treatment. Rubber bands provide added force to the aligners. They hook to Invisalign attachments, small fixtures attached to certain teeth that provide more grip for the aligners and can connect the rubber bands to slowly move your teeth into their correct positions.</p>

            Invisalign chewies are a useful tool made of spongey, non-edible material that you chew to improve the fit of your aligners. They come in small rolls and can be used several times before disposing of them. Chew them daily for <span>5-10</span>  minutes to achieve the best results with your aligners.</p>

        <p class="descr2">
            One great benefit of Invisalign treatment is you can eat anything you want! The removable aligners mean there are no food restrictions during your treatment, unlike permanent braces, which require you to avoid any hard and/or sticky foods.

            You do have to remove your aligners to eat or drink anything but water, however: eating or drinking with your aligners in can damage and stain the aligners, as well as trap food inside the aligners and between your teeth.    </div>

        <h2 class="heading">How to Clean Invisalign Aligners</h2>
        <p class="descr2">To keep your Invisalign aligners clean and working properly, remove them between meals and before drinking anything but water. Clean them before putting them back in your mouth, by brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush and warm water or dish soap, and/or soaking them in mouthwash or Invisalign cleaning crystals. Maintaining the cleanliness and care of your Invisalign aligners is a very important part of your treatment!</p>

        <p class="descr2">Vivera™ retainers protect the results of your Invisalign treatment. You will wear them after your Invisalign course is finished. The retainers look like Invisalign aligners, but they are designed to keep your teeth in the correct positions rather than drifting back out of alignment.

            Your doctor will usually instruct you to wear the Invisalign retainers full-time for a few months, and then only at night, for a few nights a week, for as long as you can. Vivera retainers are made of patented SmartTrack material for long-lasting effectiveness and custom designed for your smile to protect the results of your treatment.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Does Invisalign Treatment Hurt?</h2>
        <p class="descr2">  Invisalign treatment is painless! The removers are made of soft, flexible SmartTrack plastic, with a scalloped edge clinically developed for a comfortable, effective fit. The SmartForce attachments are made of a safe, non-toxic dental adhesive that is painless to affix and remove.

        You may feel minor discomfort for the first day or when wearing a new set of aligners, but your teeth will adjust quickly. If the edge of an aligner is bothering your gum, you can trim with a pair of nail clippers or cuticle scissors to adjust the fit.</p>
